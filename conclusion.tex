\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper implements a tiny \SA solver of polynomial extreme points and evaluate the architectural metrics of the solver. From the experimental statistics we could draw some useful insights about the program behavior and the architectural characteristics of the program. \SA is a practical stochastic method to calculate the global optimal solution of a linear program and proved effective when solving high order polynomial expressions.

In future work I may concentrate on the combination of \SA and genetic algorithm which is also a hotspot of the current research and find more efficient methods to solve polynomial problems.
