\subsection{Mechanism of \SA}
As is mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:intro}, \SA algorithm is inspired from the natural process of gradual cooling of a melted solid to obtain the minimum energy value. This energy is equivalent to the objective function value in a conventional optimization problem.

Generally, \SA algorithm consists of three operations: generation, acceptance and cooling. Similar to genetic algorithm, \SA also includes the concept of generation. The generation operation changes the current solution $x$ and generates the next solution $x'$


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SA_prob}
P=
\begin{cases}
1 & if(\Delta E < 0) \\
e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{T}}&otherwise \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
